---

- 🧠 **Anything Unstated Gets Inferred**  
  If you leave something out of your prompt, the AI will guess, and not always how you want.

- ✂️ **Sculpt Context, Don’t Pollute It**  
  Feed the AI only what matters. Be surgical. Trim background noise, legacy docs, and side chatter.

- 🧪 **A/B Test Your AI Daily Drivers**  
  Maintain at least two paid LLMs. Compare answers, cross-check facts, and swap when one stumbles.

- 🛩️ **Pilot’s Chair Rule**  
  You drive. The AI is your copilot, not your boss. Never let the model decide the mission or mark its own homework.

- 🔒 **Protect Privacy Ruthlessly**  
  Never enter personal or confidential info into public or free AIs. Know your chat storage, licensing, and usage stats.

- 🎤 **Lean Into Multimodal**  
  Use voice, text, images—whatever lets you express your needs fastest and clearest. Don’t limit yourself to typing.

- 🗺️ **Prompt Procedurally, Think in Steps**  
  Break problems down step by step. Guide the AI like you’d mentor a human: who, what, when, where, why, how.

- 🕵️‍♂️ **Watch for Amnesia and Hallucination**  
  When the AI forgets or fabricates, call it out. Keep a backup LLM for fault tolerance and groundedness.

- 🔄 **Meta-Prompt and System-Prompt**  
  Ask the AI to refine your own prompts, summarize, or focus its response. Use meta-layer instructions for precision.

- 🏛️ **Use Pillar Jumping**  
  Leverage insights from one LLM session to nudge or challenge another. Good answers get sharper in dialogue.

**Bonus:**  
- 📝 **Never Treat AI as an Oracle**  
  Every AI answer is a draft. Validate, edit, and own the final output.
